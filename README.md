## 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

Designed and developed my personal portfolio website entirely from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The design was created using **Figma**, allowing for a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface. For implementation, I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, ensuring responsive design and smooth interactivity across devices.
